# Audiopilot plugin README

An OpenCPN plugin for visually impaired sailors. It outputs voice for boat & wind speed, heading, depth, bearing to next waypoint and supports speech recognition to alter course and select a waypoint or route. 

More user info: https://opencpn.org/OpenCPN/plugins/audiopilot.html

Building is documented in INSTALL.md

The plugin uses a continous integration setup described in the
[wiki](https://github.com/Rasbats/managed_plugins/wiki/Alternative-Workflow)
This setup is also able to push all updated metadata files to a clone
of https://github.com/OpenCPN/plugins in order to simplify pull requests
against this site.
