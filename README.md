# Demo plugin README

An OpenCPN Demonstration plugin that illustrates the use of the OpenCPN Plugin API's
The plugin does nothing useful other than guiding a plugin developer through each of the different types of API's


Building is documented in INSTALL.md

The plugin uses a continous integration setup described in the
[wiki](https://github.com/Rasbats/managed_plugins/wiki/Alternative-Workflow)
This setup is also able to push all updated metadata files to a clone
of https://github.com/OpenCPN/plugins in order to simplify pull requests
against this site.
