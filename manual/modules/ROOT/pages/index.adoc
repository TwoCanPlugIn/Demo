== 4. Using the OpenCPN Plugin API's

=== Chapter 1. Basic plugin, Mandatory API's, Logging, Plugin Folders

This is a basic plugin, that demonstrates the mandatory API's that a plugin MUST support.

Note that the class that implements the plugin, derives from an OpenCPN plugin base class. Over successive versions of OpenCPN
new functions and members have been added to the base classes. The plugin need only inherit from a base class that provides the
API's required for the plugin's desired capabilites.

Eg.DemoPlugin::DemoPlugin(void* ppimgr) : opencpn_plugin_117(ppimgr) is derived from the OpenCPN Plugin API version 1.17 base class

The mandatory API's that all plugins must implement

These two API's indicate what version of the OpenCPN API's are supported
GetAPIVersionMajor()
Eg. if the plugin is derived from OpenCPN Plugin API 1.17, the major version number is 1

GetAPIVersionMinor()
Eg. if the plugin is derived from OpenCPN Plugin API 1.17, the minor version number is 17

These three API's indicate the version number of the plugin
GetPlugInVersionMajor()
Eg. If the plugin version is 1.2.3, the major version is 1

GetPlugInVersionMinor() 
Eg. If the plugin version is 1.2.3, the major version is 2

GetPlugInVersionPatch() 
Eg. If the plugin version is 1.2.3, the patch version is 3

This returns the name of the plugin and is displayed in the Plugin Manager
GetCommonName() 

The following two API's return a long and short description, both of which are displayed in the Plugin Manager
GetShortDescription()

GetLongDescription()

This API returns the icon for the plugin whuch is displayed in the Plugin Manager. It should be a 32 x 32 pixel bitmap.
GetPlugInBitmap()

In addition the plugin dumps some of the OpenCPN standard folder paths and user's measurement units into the OpenCPN log file
using wxLogMessage. This OpenCPN log is the preferred mechanism for plugins to log messages. To log important error messages, 
you can also us wxLogError.
